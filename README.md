# SafeSound

SafeSound is an application for users to lock certain applications with a password using the voice recognition feature. When an app uses “Safe sound”, access to the app is restricted and users must identify themselves with their own voice to unlock. This gives users complete control over which applications they want to secure, combining convenience with a high level of security. Using voice recognition as a locking mechanism is an innovative solution to address application security issues.
